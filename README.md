- [Study on the impact of ChatGPT on teaching introductory programming courses (2023)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qkPObfE53NE49t9K8i9sblH1-8RvxW6W)

    Abstract – The widespread use of artificial intelligence tools is a reality that currently brings significant paradigm shifts in both the workplace and educational settings. This paper explores the impact of one of these new AI tools, ChatGPT, in teaching the basics of programming. To achieve this, we analyze the performance of this technology in assessments for an introductory C++ programming course at the Faculty of Exact, Physical, and Natural Sciences of the National University of Córdoba, Argentina. This analysis reveals that ChatGPT can successfully solve evaluative exercises with an effectiveness rate of 97%, suggesting that a student without the necessary knowledge could pass an exam. Consequently, the reliability of current evaluation methods is at risk. Additionally, it is inferred that misuse of this technology by students in early learning stages negatively impacts their education. On the other hand, the tool’s potential for validation and tutoring is highlighted when used honestly.

    -
    Abstract – A model simulating data traffic flow in a domestic Local Area Network (LAN) was implemented. For its development, network traffic data was collected from the modeled network using *Wireshark*, and the simulation model was built in the continuous systems software *Vensim*. Finally, an analysis of the obtained results was conducted, and conclusions were drawn.

    -
    Abstract – This work addresses the complete design process of a control system for loading a mixer via an auger. Throughout the paper, a detailed mathematical model describing the proposed system is developed. Subsequently, a rigorous analysis of the obtained model is conducted, followed by the proposal and evaluation of a control scheme aligned with the outlined needs. The work concludes with the presentation of the findings.

- [Spectrum detection in cognitive radio networks: optimization and threshold analysis (2022)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TUuhHut5LxvuKjVRXF-GJJU0QivbYkBM)
    -
    Abstract – The radio spectrum is a limited and essential resource for radiocommunication usage. To increase efficiency in the use of this resource, Cognitive Radio (CR) networks have emerged, which incorporate functions such as environment awareness (e.g., radiofrequency spectrum) through various detection techniques. This study focuses on two of these detection techniques: the energy detector and the entropy detector, both tested using a QPSK signal in an AWGN channel.
